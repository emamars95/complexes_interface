# Analyzing Complex Interfaces with Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter notebook analyzes the interface between two proteins, Prot_A and Prot_B, using a multi-step analytical pipeline.
The purpose of this pipeline is to provide insights that can inform future interface redesign efforts.

### The notebook demonstrates individual steps of the pipeline for a specific use case:

- Prot_A: SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
- Prot_B: Antibody P5A-3C8
- Prot_C: ACE2
PDB entries: 6M0J and 7Z0X

### The notebook includes the following sections:

- Loading and Preprocessing Structures
- Interface Residue Identification
- Hotspot Residue Identification


## Getting Started
To use this notebook, you will need to install the following software:

- Jupyter Notebook
- PyMOL 

Once you have installed the necessary software and downloaded the PDB entries, you can run the notebook and follow the steps outlined in each section.
The notebook also includes detailed explanations of each step and the underlying concepts and methods used.
